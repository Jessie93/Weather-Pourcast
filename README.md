# Weather Pourcast

## Description
We've created a website that provides users with a unique experience by offering cocktail recommendations based on the temperature at their location. After a user enters their town or city, we'll suggest the perfect drink. Features include:
* Modal to check whether users are 18 on page load
* A random cocktail suggested on page load including name, picture, ingridients and instructions
* Input section for users to enter their town or city
* Integration of OpenWeather API to check the temperature in the location entered
* Integration of TheCocktailDB API to access hundreds of cocktails
* Feedback regarding the temperature at the user's location
* A cocktail is suggested with an appropriate base ingridient (whisky, rum, gin, vodka, or tequilla) for the temperature
* The ability for users to add cocktails to their favourites - these are added to local storage and disaplayed on their 'Favourites' page
* A navbar for easy navigation between main and favourites page, as well as a "back to the top" button
